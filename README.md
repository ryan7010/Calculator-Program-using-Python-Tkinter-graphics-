A calculator program made by me nearly 4 years during lockdown (when I was 10 years old) using TKinter graphics (Python).
This was one of the biggest projects I have ever made on Python (took me nearly a week) but was never able to show it to anyone (only a few friends).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
calculator.py is the main program where all the self-made modules have been imported.
divc, difc, proc, sumc and are the modules where each one is used to add, subtract, muliply and divide (they are windows that will open when you click on a button.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Note:* there are some bugs in the modules (like ZeroDivisionError) that I haven't debugged (just wanted to leave it at that)
